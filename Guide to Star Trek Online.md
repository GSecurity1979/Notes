# Math

base weapon dmg * weapon power * +dmg(cat1) * +bonus dmg(cat2) * haste(cat3) * attack upgrade/weapon mods(final multipliers) -target resists = resulting dmg (crtd is regarded as bonus dmg, but it relies on crth)

# Important

Some stuff is for veterans, and lowest vet tier unlocks at 100 days. Type "/played" into chat window.

# How to play

Piloting: Use both mouse buttons pressed at same time to pilot your ship. If you use cannons, stop at 9km from target and shoot. If you use beam arrays,
fly around non stop, preferably directly below or above targets. If you have low turn rate, try to keep engines at half speed.

Pve is mostly about dmg and to multiple targets, while Pvp is about tanking and dmg to single target.

# Tips

If you get shot at, placate the target. 

Move as fast as you can by triggering your fortified engines with aux to sif, your conn officer from phoenix, epte and evasive maneouvers.

Your tac, sci and eng seat number 1 should have team power so you can clear debuffs (plus polarize hull).

Without subnuke, you will always be subpar in pvp.

Try to extend uptime and reduce cd of your attack upgrade, it is essential for high dps required for elite content.

Try not to double up on boff powers, or use two different attack patterns. 

Google each boff power on stowiki, and if it puts other skills on cd, don't use those other skills.

Haste is very much important

Sometimes only diff between you doing 100k dps and someone doing 300k is their max hit so crits (even from pets) are very much important.

Avoid EPG builds unless you are in all EPG team because taking out enemy shields both brings dps, and if you don't take out their shields, makes your team job more difficult.

Get all reps maxed out even if you don't need the gear. They will appear in your passives and you may need the traits, ship modules and respecs.

Do all of R&D by doing 20h tasks. At level 15, they will give you nice traits and you'll be able to craft nice stuff.

Under HUD space options, select maintain auto attack and enable never target pets and objects and aoe asisst. All other options off.

You can enable autofire on your hangar and your weps by right clicking on them, but do so in order which weapon recharges fastest is enabled first.

You will need to aquire ships for stuff they have, not to fly them. Pick ship you like and stay with it, just get other ships stuff for use on your own ship.

Do not rely on 2.5% proc chance anything. 

Always go for stuff that is per hit. 

Google everything and look if it's per cycle or per hit, or for a time period.

Regarding uptime, it would be a good idea to rely on stuff that has high uptime, provided it does decent dmg during it's uptime.

Try to login for at least 15 mins a day, if nothing else, just to do events, preferably an hour to do your daily missions too.

Advanced consoles you can only slot 1 type of, so slot ones your ship has most of.

# Space Keybinds

Copy the following in notepad and save as `Space.txt`. Then while you are in space in STO, type `/unbind_all` and then `/bind_load_file D:\Space.txt` (or the path where you saved the file). 
Assign your powers to tray 10, 9, 8 and 7 and keep pressing spacebar during combat. Press number 1 once to pull the trigger.

# Ground keybinds

Copy the following in notepad and save as Ground.txt. Then while you are on ground in STO, type /unbind_all and then /bind_load_file D:\Ground.txt (or path where you saved the file). 
Assign your abilities to tray 2 and 3, make sure basic weapon fire is in default location (tray 1 slot 1) and keep pressing key 1 during combat. 
space is for jump and both mouse buttons for sprint.
